 Crystal Collector

 This is a simple game using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.

 The player is given a random target number at the start of each game. Each crystal is also given a random number for that game. The player clicks on the cystals to add points to their score. If they match the target number, they win. If they exceed the target number, they lose.
